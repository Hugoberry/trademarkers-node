                    <p> Trademark application process can be described in three simple steps.</p>

                            <h4><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preliminary Study</h4>
                            <p>Although optional, it is beneficial to conduct a study of your target market prior to filing a trademark there. This provides information on the probability of successful registration, as well as details on competing brands and potential conflicts. Based on this information, you can make informed decisions for your trademark.</p>

                            <p>TradeMarkers manages the entire filing process with trademark authorities. We liaise between all parties, keeping you up-to-date on your application status. If any objections are raised against your trademark or if there are complications, you will be informed as soon as possible for consultation.</p>

                            <p> When your application is complete, we will deliver a certificate of registration along with all pertinent details. At this point, monitoring is recommended for protection against infringement and copycat branding. Our monitoring service regularly checks your target markets for trademark similarities and advises you if any are found.</p>

                                        <h4>I want to get an idea of where I can use my trademark</h4>
                                        <p> The first step towards attaining a trademark is to find out if it is available at all in your target regions. Some countries have readily available information on the internet for existing registrations, while others do not even have a website. A trademark study is the best way to get answers and identify opportunities to attain your trademark.</p>

                                        <h4>I want a trademark registered in a specific country</h4>
                                        <p> If your brand will be used in a single country and you have no plans to expand elsewhere, the simplest solution may be to attain a trademark in just that country. This tends to be a simpler and less expensive process than registering across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
                                        <p> If your target country is part of a treaty region, it may make more sense to register with the relevant regional trademark authority. This allows for registration across multiple countries in a single application, often at only a small difference in cost. Major treaties include the European Union, Benelux, OAPI, and ARIPO.

                                        <p> If you need trademark protection in several countries, or if you plan to expand your brand later, there are several options:</p>

                                            <li> If your target countries do not share a common treaty region, you can register separately with each respective country’s trademark office</li>
                                            <li> If the countries fall under a treaty, you can register with the treaty office</li>
                                            <li> You can register under the Paris Convention, a treaty which covers most countries worldwide</li>

                                        <p> Treaty regions are formed by certain countries which share a common language, geography, or economy. These allow trademarks to be registered across all member countries in a single application. Registration under a treaty is typically more simple than applying in multiple countries individually, and it allows for broader protection of trademarks.</p>

                                        <p> Some treaty regions include:</p>

                                        <p> Countries which recognize the Paris Convention are also considered a treaty region. This system, administered by the Paris Convention, allows for a single, streamlined application for multiple countries. Although very convenient, it is not a universal solution for worldwide trademark filing. Your trademark may face oppositions in certain countries, and individual trademark offices ultimately reserve the right to accept or reject applications at their own discretion.</p>

                                        <p> Priority filing <i>(also known as priority right or right of priority)</i> is the time-limited right of the owner of a trademark to file subsequent applications in other jurisdictions for the same trademark. To claim this right, the subsequent applications must be filed within six months (not twelve months, as in the case of patents) of the submission date of the initial application. Priority filing applies only to countries which are members of the Paris Convention.</p>
                                        <p> For example, a company may want to file a trademark in Germany and Canada. An application is made to Germany on January 1st, giving the applicant first priority across Paris Convention until June 30th. As long as the Canadian application is made by June 30th, it claims priority.</p>
