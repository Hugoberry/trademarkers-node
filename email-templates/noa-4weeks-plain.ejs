  Dear <%= name[1] ? name[1].trim() : 'Trademarkers Client' %>,
</p>
<p style="margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  I wanted to follow up with you, as until now we have not year received any response from you how to handle the “Notice of Allowance” that was issued on <%= mailData.dateFiledFormatted %>.
</p>
<p style="margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Alongside with your declaration, you need to include a “specimen” (like a photo, screen grab of a website where the product is offered etc.) – as the examiner needs to see that you are actually offering the product or service to the public in the United States.
</p>
<p style="margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  As a reminder, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a “Notice of Allowance” (NOA), which means that in principle you have received the green light for your brand <%= mailData.trademark.name %> to be registered as a trademark, but unlike many other trademark jurisdictions, the USPTO makes the registration of a trademark dependent on actual use, and a “Statement of Use” must be made before the 6 month deadline after issuance (<%= mailData.dateDeadFormatted %>).
</p>
<p style="margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  In case you are unable to declare use right now, you can file for an extension and get another 6 months (but there are limits after that).

    You can see this "Notice of Allowance" (and the continued progress of your trademark application) in the database of the USPTO at: <br>
