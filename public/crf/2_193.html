Once the applicant, registrant or party has designated a qualified practitioner(s), the named practitioner may sign an associate power of attorney appointing another qualified practitioner(s) as an additional person(s) authorized to prosecute the application or registration. If the applicant, registrant, or party revokes the original power of attorney, the revocation discharges any associate power signed by the practitioner whose power has been revoked. If the practitioner who signed an associate power withdraws, the withdrawal discharges any associate power signed by the withdrawing practitioner upon acceptance of the request for withdrawal by the Office. </li>

Violations of <a href="11_18.html">§ 11.18(b)</a> of this chapter may jeopardize the validity of the application or registration, and may result in the imposition of sanctions under <a href="11_18.html">§ 11.18(c)</a> of this chapter. Any practitioner violating <a href="11_18.html">§ 11.18(b)</a> of this chapter may also be subject to disciplinary action.
