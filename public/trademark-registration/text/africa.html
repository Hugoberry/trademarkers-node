<h2>Trademark in Africa</h2>
There are two inter-governmental Intellectual Property organizations in Africa: ARIPO and OAPI.
ARIPO member states also have their own IP legislation that coexist with the Harare Protocol.
On the other hand, OAPI member states do not have their own Intellectual Property legislation.
